Problem Statement:
Developing an efficient and user-friendly subtitle service tailored specifically for YouTube Shorts to enhance accessibility and engagement for a diverse audience.
Background Study:
1.User Experience and Preferences-
50% of Americans turn on subtitles “most of the time.” That number jumps all the way up to 80% for Gen Z.

And it’s not just personal preference. Data shows that subtitles and captions matter for viewer retention and engagement, too (aka what really matters

Facts about subtitles
80% of viewers are more likely to finish a video with subtitles
85% of all videos on Facebook are watched with the sound off
80% of viewers respond negatively to video ads that auto-play sound
37% of viewers said video subtitles encourage them to turn the sound on
One company saw an 7.32% total increase in YouTube views after adding subtitles
61% of people who localize their video content translate their subtitles

A joint study from Verizon and Publicis Media found up to 80% of viewers are more likely to finish a video with subtitles. Half of those viewers preferred captions because they like watching videos with sound off.

Platforms affect a viewer's preferences as well: Meta famously reported that 85% of all Facebook videos were being watched with the sound off. Preference for subtitles is still strong for longer-form videos as we'll cover below, but this is a good signal that captions go from nice-to-have to must-have for short-form video on social media.

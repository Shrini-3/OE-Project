## SUBTITLE SERVICES FOR YOUTUBE SHORTS

# Problem Statement:
Developing an efficient and user-friendly subtitle service tailored specifically for YouTube Shorts to enhance accessibility and engagement for a diverse audience.
## Background Study:
1.User Experience and Preferences-
50% of Americans turn on subtitles “most of the time.” That number jumps all the way up to 80% for Gen Z.

And it’s not just personal preference. Data shows that subtitles and captions matter for viewer retention and engagement.

# Facts about subtitles
80% of viewers are more likely to finish a video with subtitles
85% of all videos on Facebook are watched with the sound off
80% of viewers respond negatively to video ads that auto-play sound
37% of viewers said video subtitles encourage them to turn the sound on
One company saw an 7.32% total increase in YouTube views after adding subtitles
61% of people who localize their video content translate their subtitles

# 2.Quality Control and Editing Tools-
Quality assurance in subtitling includes checking:
 Audio Synchronization
 Timing and Duration
 Text Formatting
 Platform and Device Compatibility
 Language Accuracy
 Consistency and Style
 Synchronization
 Line breaks

# 3.Integration with Video Platform-
  VEED.IO-
  VEED.IO offers video subtitling in three main ways: 
  a)Manual typing, 
  b)Automatic subtitle generating,
  c)Uploading a text file (it supports the formats of SRT, VTT, TXT, ASS, SSA). Irrespective of how you wish to subtitle the video, you can decide the text’s fonts, colors, size, and timings.
  Rev
  Rev’s services to add subtitles to video makes your video appealing, boosts your SEO, and helps you cater to a larger audience. 
  It works with almost any format, from MP4, MOV, and VOB to AVI and OGG.
  AmberScript
  You have both with AmberScript — man and the machine for subtitling and transcribing.
  While their AI engine can subtitle in 39 languages, their experts can do it in eleven languages.
  They have pre-paid and subscription-based plans for automatic subtitling. And the manual service is time-based and also offers translated subtitling.
  SubtitleBee
  SubtitleBee is an AI-powered video subtitle generator. 
  You can add closed captions and change the head title in different styles, fonts, and colors to make your video attractive. 
  You can also customize the auto-captioning settings to enhance creativity.

# 4.Cost Consideration-
 Captioning prices can differ from vendor to vendor. Ultimately, pricing will come down to video duration, service, features, and quality.
 Most vendors charge per minute. Captioning rates can range from $1 per minute to $15 per minute. Some vendors round up per minute, which can add up quickly if you have many short files.
 Some vendors also charge fees. For example, vendors might charge extra for multiple speakers, caption formats, resubmissions, or video platform integrations.
 Using automatic speech recognition (ASR) is cheap and fast but often painfully inaccurate. 
 YouTube, for example, offers free automatic captioning, but accuracy rates can range from 60% to 70%. 
 Thus, you end up spending more time fixing your ASR captions.
5.File formats-
 SubRipper (.srt)
 The SubRipper format, commonly known as SRT, is widely supported by subtitle converters and players. 
 It features a concise and easily understandable structure. 
 When opened with a text editor, an SRT file displays the time when the text appears and the corresponding subtitles. 
 This format is widely compatible and can be edited without difficulty.
 MicroDVD (.sub)
 SUB subtitles are like the reliable Swiss Army knife of subtitles. 
 They are named after MicroDVD, the software that popularized this format. 
 What sets SUB apart is its straightforwardness and effectiveness.
 WebVTT (.vtt)
 The WebVTT format, often referred to as VTT, holds a prominent place in the world of subtitles. 
 It’s recognized as a W3C standard, making it a dependable choice for web-based content. 
 VTT subtitles are prized for their simplicity and compatibility, ensuring accessibility across various platforms.
 STL (Spruce Subtitle File)
 STL (Spruce Subtitle File) is a widely used binary subtitle format primarily employed in the broadcasting and video production industries. 
 STL files contain graphical representations of subtitles in the form of bitmaps, allowing for precise styling, positioning, and timing.
# 6.WCAG for accesibility standards and compilance inclusivity-
 What is required in the WCAG standard at Level A, AA, and AAA. (WCAG is introduced in the Planning page of this resource.)
 What is needed to meet user needs, beyond WCAG. If there are no “A”s, then it is not required in WCAG.
 Audio-only (e.g., podcast):
 For pre-recorded:
 Captions are useful for people who are hard of hearing to get the richness of listening to the audio and fill in what they don’t hear well by reading the captions.
 Captions are not required to meet WCAG. (Transcripts are at Level A.)
 For live:
 Captions are useful for people who are hard of hearing to get the richness of listening to the audio and fill in what they don’t hear well by reading the captions.
 Live text stream or accurate script of the audio available when live is in WCAG at Level AAA.
 Video-only (no audio content):
 For pre-recorded and live:
 Captions are not needed because there is no audio information.
 Video with audio content:
 Does the video have audio information that is needed to understand what the video is communicating?
 If no (for example, it is just background music):
 Captions are not needed because there is no important audio content. Consider informing users.
 If yes:
 For pre-recorded:
 Captions are needed to provide the audio content to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.
 Captions are required in WCAG at Level A.
 For live:
 Captions are needed to provide the audio content to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.
 Captions are required in WCAG at Level AA.
